# 🌦️ Weather Trends Analysis (2021–2023)

This project analyzes weather trends using daily historical weather data over three years (2021–2023). It includes temperature, rainfall, and humidity analysis using R.

## 📁 Files Included
- `weather_data.csv` – Cleaned weather data file
- `weather_analysis.R` – Main R script for data cleaning, visualization, and insights
- `Weather_Analysis_Presentation.pptx` – PowerPoint presentation summarizing the findings

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries
- Language: R
- Libraries: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `lubridate`, `readr`

## 📊 Key Insights
- Seasonal temperature patterns (hotter in summer, colder in winter)
- Rainfall distribution is highly skewed with seasonal peaks
- Humidity levels inversely related to temperature

## 📚 References
See full references in the project summary section or presentation.

## ✅ How to Run
1. Open the `weather_analysis.R` script in R or RStudio
2. Make sure the `weather_data.csv` is in the same folder
3. Run the script step by step
